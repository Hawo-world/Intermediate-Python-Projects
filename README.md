This repository features a collection of begginer-level projects Iâ€™ve created to practice and improve my Python  skills. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python, including problem-solving, algorithms, data manipulation, and working with external libraries. 

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use these projects as a learning resource!
